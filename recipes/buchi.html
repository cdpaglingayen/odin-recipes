 <h4>Description</h4>
 <p>This buchi recipe makes deep-fried glutinous rice flour balls filled with sweetened mung beans for a yummy Pinoy
  snack.</p>

 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>1 ¼ cups water, divided</li>
  <li>3 ½ ounces green mung beans</li>
  <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
  <li>2 cups glutinous rice flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 quart cooking oil</li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Steps</h4>
 <ol>
  <li>Combine 1 cup water and mung beans in a pot and bring to a boil; cook over medium heat until beans are very
   tender, about 30 minutes. Mash beans thoroughly, then stir in 1/2 cup sugar until well combined; set aside.</li>
  <li>Mix together rice flour, remaining 1/4 cup water, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a large bowl; knead just enough
   to form a ball. Divide dough into small pieces and roll into balls. Flatten each dough ball, then spoon 1 tablespoon
   mashed bean mixture into the middle of dough. Wrap dough around bean mixture and pinch edges to seal.</li>
  <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry balls in batches in hot oil until
   golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.</li>
 </ol>
